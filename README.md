# Moon Lander Tutorial

UCL computer science website has a [tutorial showing how to "make a very simple Lunar Lander game in JavaScript"](http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/schoolslab/projects/HT5/index.html), which I thought looked neat, but sadly it doesn't work! The code is slightly broken in various ways, and more frustratingly it says "Published using GitBook" yet I couldn't find any git repo to submit my PRs, or even any contact details.

This repo has the code after I fixed it up, and the commit history shows those fixes, from a starting point of the javascript code given at the end of [the 3rd lesson](http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/schoolslab/projects/HT5/pages/making_the_spaceship.html).
